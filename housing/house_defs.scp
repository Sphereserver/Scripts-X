// OSI Housing System
// Features:
//		Put house up for sale via sign, Ideal for static buildings.
//
// Variable Property Tax: This will allow you to set regions to be cheaper/more expensive than the default, ideal for building player towns or charging for those high traffic zones like Britain.
//			use this feature the def.maintenance_fee MUST be turned on.
//			To set an area with a different rate simple go to that place and set region.tag.maintenance_override to the percentage figure you want.
//			All houses placed in this area will be charge at that percent rather than the rate set in defs.
//			Players can check a region's maintenance rate by using .rate
//
// Estate Tax:		This comes into effect when set to a number other than 0 (but lower than def.account_house_limit if set) and a player has MORE than this number of houses.
//			def.hs_estate_rate will be overridden by regional maintenance rates.
//			Flate rate (def.hs_estate_calc = 1) adds an extra def.hs_estate_rate or regional maintenance rate to the cost to refresh a house when a player has more than <def.hs_estate_tax> houses regardless of how many.
//			Linear rate (def.hs_estate_calc = 2) adds 1 def.hs_estate_rate or regional maintenance rate for each house over <def.hs_estate_tax> (gets more expensive with more houses)
//
//		To retain the house the player should use another character on the account and use the transfer ownership option on that character 
//		(you can use this to transfer the house around the chars in account) BEFORE they delete the named character.
